# shoe-modeling-project
This React project was created in order to model a 3d shoe with its different components.

The shoe was made in Blender, by Yuri Artiukh.

I was able to do this through libraries such as Three.js, GLTFJSX

The user can interact with the color picker to color each part of the shoe, through assigning different states to each.
