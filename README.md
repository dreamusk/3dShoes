# shoe-modeling-project
This React project was created in order to model a 3d shoe with its different components
I was able to do this through libraries such as Three.js, GLTFJSX
The user can interact with the color picker to color each part of the shoe, through assigning different states to each.

this a website which shows option how to display the object in the 3 dimensions
